# Multi Agent Simulation

This repository contains a simple cellular automata style simulation written in JavaScript.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Use the speed slider to adjust how fast the simulation runs. The page also displays a line chart of grass, herbivore, and carnivore counts over time. The main canvas shows grass (green), herbivores (blue), and carnivores (red). Each step, agents move randomly, eat, reproduce, or die based on their energy.
