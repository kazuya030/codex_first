# Multi Agent Simulation

This repository contains a simple cellular automata style simulation written in JavaScript.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. The canvas will show grass (green), herbivores (blue), and carnivores (red). Each step, agents move randomly, eat, reproduce, or die based on their energy.
